    <h4 id='about'> Music Recommendation System by Sai Vishvesh V.<div class="break"></div><div class="break"></div><div class="break"></div>

        This project involves the creation of a Music recommendation system using Python, with the utilization of libraries such as pandas, sklearn, etc. The project includes a website developed using the Flask framework for Python. The core functionality of the recommendation system is based on extracting specific features from the input music provided by the user.<div class="break"></div>
        <div class="break"></div>
        The process of recommendation involves selecting particular features using feature extraction methods, which are accessed through the Spotipy API. These features are then assigned weights using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm. Subsequently, the system generates appropriate song recommendations based on the user's input. This input could be in the form of a song URL or a playlist.
